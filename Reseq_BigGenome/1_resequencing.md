Perform two resequencing jobs using contigSet1.fa and contigSet2.fa as the references and the full subread dataset for both. Downstream scripts work with SMRT Link job directories but can be modified for command line resequencing.

I recommend the following settings be changed from the default:

1. Concordant alignment: FALSE
2. Minimum (alignment) length: 500
3. Minimum subread length: 500
